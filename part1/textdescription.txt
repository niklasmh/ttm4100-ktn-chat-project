This will be a short textual description of our design. 

_Init_() creates a client and initiates run() which will establish a TCP-connection between the client and the server. Every time a new client connects to the server at new ClientHandler object is created. Now the Client should forever listen to user input and the ClientHandler should forever listen to client requests.

Communication with the ClientHandler will happen like this:
   1. User input will be converted into a payload.
   2. send_payload() will encode with JSON and send the payload to the ClientHandler.
   3. The Clienthandler will call the MessageReceiver which will save the payload and call the MessageParser.
   4. The MessageParser will use parse() and decode from JSON to determine if the request is in possible responses.
   5. MessageParser will use parse_???() to convert payload into a String and send it to the Client.
   6. The Client will print the String.
